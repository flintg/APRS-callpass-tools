This is a little library I decided to build because I got tired of
people waiting for other people to give them their APRS code.
Sometimes wait times would reach weeks long.

I think this is a much more elegant solution. Automated checking of whether 
the requestee is in the FCC database, and if their license is current.
Less hassle for humans, less pissoff-ery for the person needing their code. :)

See example.py (or just run it) for example.
I just made it to have a convenient frontend for the tools.



Author's note:

	I'm basically a newbie to python, so if you'd like to help, feel free!
Just try to explain changes (in comments) instead of telling me I'm an idiot :)
